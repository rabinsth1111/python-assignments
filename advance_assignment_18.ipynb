    "#### Q1. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n",
    "**Ans:** The differences between Text Files and Binary Files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text files** are special subset of binary files that are used to store human readable characters as a rich text document or plain text document. Text files also store data in sequential bytes but bits in text file represents characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary files** are those typical files that store data in the form of sequence of bytes grouped into eight bits or sometimes sixteen bits. These bits represent custom data and such files can store multiple types of data (images, audio, text, etc) under a single file."

    "#### Q2. What are some scenarios where using text files will be the better option? When would you like to use binary files instead of text files?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "Text files are often preferred in scenarios where human readability and easy editing are essential. Some situations where using text files is the better option include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configuration files: Text files are commonly used for storing configuration settings for software applications because they can be easily modified by users and developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Source code: Programming source code is typically stored in text files, as it allows developers to write, read, and version control code easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Markup languages: Text files are used for writing markup languages like HTML, XML, or JSON, which structure data in a human-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data interchange: When data needs to be shared between different systems or transmitted over the internet, text-based formats like CSV, JSON, or XML are often preferred for their interoperability and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files, on the other hand, are suitable in situations where data needs to be stored or transmitted in a more efficient and compact form. Use binary files when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Performance is critical: Binary files are more efficient for storing large datasets, such as images, audio, or video, as they reduce the overhead of character encoding and can be processed more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data privacy and security: Binary formats can be used to obscure data and protect it from casual inspection, making them useful for proprietary or sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Specific data structures: Certain applications, like databases or game engines, require custom data structures that are better represented as binary files for speed and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compatibility with specialized software: Some applications rely on proprietary or custom binary formats, making it necessary to use binary files to work with them.\n"

    "#### Q3. What are some of the issues with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disc?\n",
    "**Ans:** Using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disk can be challenging and error-prone due to several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Platform and Endianness Differences:  If we write binary data to disk on one platform and try to read it on another with a different endianness, the data may be interpreted incorrectly, leading to data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Type and Size Variations: Python integers can vary in size (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit) depending on the platform and Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Type Safety: Python integers can have different representations and are subject to dynamic typing. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Portability: Binary data written to disk using one Python version or implementation (e.g., CPython, Jython, PyPy) may not be portable to other implementations or versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Error Handling: Reading and writing binary data directly to disk requires careful error handling. \n"

    "#### Q4. Describe a benefit of using the with keyword instead of explicitly opening a file ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Benefits of using the with keyword instead of explicitly opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automatic Cleanup and Exception Handling: When we use the with statement to open a file, the file is automatically closed when the code block within the with statement is exited, either due to successful execution or an exception. On the other hand, if the file remain open, it may lead to data corruption or resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved Readability: Using the with statement makes your code more readable and concise. It clearly defines the scope in which the file is used, making it easier to understand the purpose and lifecycle of the file."
