    "#### Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all ?\n",
    "**Ans:** A probability distribution describes how a random variable is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us which values a random variable is most likely to take on and which values are less likely. Based on the previous data and the occurences of the random event, we can predict the outcome in terms of probabilities. "

    "#### Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "**Ans:** : True random numbers are generated from a process that is inherently unpredictable. This could be a physical process, like atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, or electronic noise in a circuit. True random numbers are genuinely unpredictable and provide a high level of randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random numbers are generated by algorithms and are not truly random. They are determined by an initial value called a seed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-Random Numbers are Considered \"Good Enough\" because of following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can be initialized with a seed, making them reproducible, which is useful for debugging and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They are computationally less expensive and can generate sequences of numbers quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. They are suitable for many applications, such as simulations, and statistical sampling."

    "#### Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution ?\n",
    "**Ans:** One real-life example of a normal distribution is the distribution of human heights in a population. In many populations, heights tend to follow a normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to measure the heights of a large group of people and create a histogram of the data, we would likely observe a bell-shaped curve, with the majority of people clustered around the average height and fewer people at the extremes (very tall or very short)."

    "#### Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows ?\n",
    "**Ans:** In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution can be somewhat unpredictable due to the influence of random variations. However, as the number of trials increases, the distribution tends to stabilize and approach a more consistent pattern. This phenomenon is described by the law of large numbers and is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The law of large numbers states that as the number of trials or observations increases, the sample mean will converge to the true mean of the population, and the sample proportion will converge to the true probability. In other words, the more data you collect, the more reliable and representative your estimates become.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you were flipping a fair coin, in the short term, you might observe a few heads or tails in a row, creating some variability. However, as you continue to flip the coin a larger number of times, the proportion of heads and tails should approach 0.5, reflecting the true probability of each outcome for a fair coin."
