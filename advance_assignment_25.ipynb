    "#### Q1. What is the distinction between a numpy array and a pandas data frame? Is there a way to convert between the two if there is ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames are both data structures used in Python for handling and manipulating data, but they have some key differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy Array:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Homogeneous:** Numpy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Single-Dimensional or Multi-Dimensional:** Numpy arrays can be one-dimensional (like a list) or multi-dimensional (like a matrix or tensor).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Low-level:** Numpy provides a low-level interface to data storage with basic mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Lacks Labels:** Numpy arrays don't have labeled axes; they are accessed by integer indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas DataFrame:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Heterogeneous:** Pandas DataFrames can hold data of different types, making them more flexible for handling real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Two-Dimensional Tabular Structure:** DataFrames are two-dimensional, tabular data structures with labeled axes (rows and columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. High-level Interface:** Pandas provides a high-level interface for data manipulation, with many built-in functions for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Labeled Axes:** DataFrames have labeled rows and columns, making it easy to access data using meaningful labels."
