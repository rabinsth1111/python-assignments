    "#### Q1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at the runtime ?\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "The += operator is an in-place addition operator. Consider for example a += 1, when we use a += 1, it modifies the value of a in-place, directly updating the existing object in memory. This means that no new object is created, and the operation is performed more efficiently in terms of memory and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand when we use a = a + 1, we are actually creating a new object as the result of the addition (a + 1). This new object is assigned to a, overwriting the original value. This involves memory allocation, creating a new object, and then assigning it to a, which is less efficient compared to in-place addition."

    "**Ans:** In Python, functions are considered \"first-class objects,\" which means they can be treated like any other object, such as integers, strings, or lists. This characteristic allows to perform several operations with functions that we can't easily do in languages like C++ or Java. Here are some things we can do with functions in Python that we can't do as easily in C or C++:\n",

    "1. Assign functions to variables.\n",
