    "#### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "**Ans:** An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods."
