    "#### Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "**Ans:** Regular Expressions, also known as **regex** or **regexp**, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. <br/>We can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. It helps the programmers to write less and cleaner code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the benefits of using regular expressions in Python:\n",

    "#### Q2. Describe the difference between the effects of \"(ab)c+\" and \"a(bc)+\" Which of these, if any, is the unqualified pattern \"abc+\"?\n",
    "**Ans:** The regular expressions \"(ab)c+\" and \"a(bc)+\" have distinct meanings and will match different patterns in strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (ab)c+ :<br/>\n",
    "\"(ab)\" is a subpattern that matches the exact sequence \"ab\" in the input string.<br/>\n",
    "\"c+\" means one or more occurrences of the character \"c\" immediately following the \"ab\" sequence. It can match patterns like \"abc\", \"abcc\", \"abccc\", and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. a(bc)+ : <br/>\n",
    "\"a\" matches the character \"a\" in the input string.<br/>\n",

    "**Ans:** The characters that have special significance in square brackets when expressing a range are:\n",

    "**1.Hyphen -:** When we place a hyphen between two characters inside square brackets, it creates a character range.<br/>\n",
    "Examples:<br/>\n",

    "[A-Z]: Matches any uppercase letter.<br/>\n",
